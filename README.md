# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe game built using Angular. This is a simple implementation of the classic game where two players take turns to mark symbols ('X' and 'O') on a 3x3 grid, aiming to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the game up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) should be installed. You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
 ```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe-angular.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd tic-tac-toe-angular
```

3. Install project dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Game

1. Start the development server:
```bash
ng serve
```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to play the game.

## How to Play

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.

2. Players take turns to make a move by clicking on an empty cell on the grid.

3. The first player starts with 'X', and the second player uses 'O'.

4. The game continues until one player wins by getting three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, or until the entire grid is filled, resulting in a draw.

## Features

- Interactive game interface built using Angular components.
- Simple game logic to handle player turns and determine the winner.
- Error handling for invalid moves and preventing overwriting of occupied cells.
